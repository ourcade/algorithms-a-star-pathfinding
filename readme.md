# A* Pathfinding
> Example implementation of A* algorithm in JavaScript

## Overview

This is and example showing the implementation of the A* search algorithm within a 2D grid. An implementation of Breadth-first Search is also included to show how A* builds on top of those ideas.

You can find explanations of the code in these videos on YouTube:

- [Pathfinding with Breadth-first Search](https://youtu.be/KwZgpPnqgLU)
- [A* Star Search for Pathfinding](https://youtu.be/j8FNQLN-mMA)

The code uses modern JavaScript and the Pencil.js library to render squares and show what the algorith does each iteration.
